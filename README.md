**Local Lingust Android Client**

This is the Android application for the RHoK Melbourne Timor Leste Linguistic project.

Local Linguist is a mobile application for capturing linguistic data from remote locations where there is insufficient funding to research and document the local languages and dialects that exist. This has been developed on the Android platform to make it as widely available as possible.

To build the application you will need Android Studio.

*To install and run the Local Linguist Client*:

    git clone https://github.com/RHoKAustralia/melb-timor-leste.git
    open the LanguageRecorder directory in Android Studio
    run using Android Studio

*Local Linguist Server*

The server component and instructions for setting it up are avaliable here:
